# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Customer-Reviews
This project implements sentiment analysis using a machine learning approach with the Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. Sentiment analysis aims to automatically classify text data, such as customer reviews, into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

Key Components:
1. Data Loading:
   - The script loads a dataset containing text reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels. This dataset serves as the basis for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.

2. Data Exploration:
   - The structure of the dataset is explored to understand the format of the reviews and their labels.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - The dataset is preprocessed, with the 'text' column representing reviews and the 'label' column representing sentiment. The data is then split into training and testing sets.

4. Text Vectorization:
   - TF-IDF vectorization is applied to convert text data into numerical features, capturing the importance of words in the reviews. The vectorization is performed separately for the training and testing sets.

5. Model Selection and Training:
   - A Naive Bayes classifier is chosen for sentiment analysis. The model is trained on the TF-IDF-transformed training data.

6. Model Evaluation:
   - The accuracy and classification report metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing set.

7. Prediction for New Reviews:
   - The trained model is applied to predict sentiments for new reviews provided in the 'new_reviews' list. The predictions are displayed alongside the corresponding reviews.

Usage:
1. Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual path to your dataset containing 'text' and 'label' columns.
2. Run the script to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate the sentiment analysis model.
3. Observe the accuracy and classification report metrics, and use the model to predict sentiments for new reviews.

Note:
Experiment with different classifiers, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the sentiment analysis model.
