# 📝 Sentiment Analysis for Customer Reviews

This project is a simplified **Sentiment Analysis** application built with **Python** and **Scikit-learn**. It classifies customer reviews into **positive** or **negative** sentiments, helping businesses understand customer feedback.

## 🔹 Features

* Preprocesses raw customer reviews (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
* Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert text into numerical features.
* Trains machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) for sentiment classification.
* Evaluates models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Provides a simple script to test new customer reviews.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib / Seaborn (for evaluation plots)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load dataset of customer reviews.
2. Preprocess and clean text data.
3. Convert text to vectors using **TF-IDF**.
4. Train sentiment classification models.
5. Evaluate and test predictions on new reviews.
